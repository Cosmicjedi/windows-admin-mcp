# Windows Admin MCP Server - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This MCP server provides Windows server administration capabilities through WinRM/PowerShell remoting. It's designed to troubleshoot issues, execute commands, and manage Windows servers remotely.

## Key Implementation Details

### Connection Method
The server uses WinRM (Windows Remote Management) protocol instead of full RDP sessions. This allows for:
- Lightweight command execution
- PowerShell remoting
- No GUI overhead
- Scriptable administration

### Logging System
All operations are logged to date-stamped files:
- Format: `{hostname}-{MMDDYYYY}.log`
- Configurable directory via `WINDOWS_ADMIN_LOG_DIR`
- Timestamped entries for audit trail
- Daily rotation

### Authentication
Credentials are:
- Passed in real-time per operation
- Not stored or cached
- Expected to be retrieved from external secret management
- Uses NTLM authentication over WinRM

## Tool Capabilities

### Diagnostic Tools
- **test_connection**: Network connectivity and service availability
- **diagnose_system**: Comprehensive system information gathering
- **get_performance_metrics**: Real-time performance data

### Management Tools
- **execute_command**: Direct PowerShell/CMD execution
- **check_service**: Windows service management
- **apply_solution**: Apply fix scripts

### Troubleshooting Tools
- **troubleshoot_application**: Application-specific diagnostics
- **view_logs**: Access troubleshooting history

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Troubleshooting Flow
1. Test connection to verify accessibility
2. Diagnose system to gather information
3. Troubleshoot specific application if needed
4. Apply solution based on findings
5. Verify fix with performance metrics

### Example Conversation
```
User: "The Flying Doghouse app is crashing on server SNOOPY"
Assistant: 
1. Uses test_connection to verify SNOOPY is accessible
2. Uses troubleshoot_application for "Flying Doghouse"
3. Analyzes event logs and error reports
4. Suggests solution (e.g., restart service, clear cache)
5. Uses apply_solution to implement fix
6. Confirms resolution with check_service
```

## Error Handling

All tools implement comprehensive error handling:
- Connection failures return clear error messages
- Command failures include stderr output
- Logging continues even on errors
- Graceful degradation when partial data available

## Security Best Practices

1. **Credential Management**
   - Never log passwords
   - Use secure credential providers
   - Implement least privilege principle

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS WinRM when possible
   - Restrict source IPs
   - Implement network segmentation

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All operations logged
   - Timestamps for forensics
   - User attribution in logs

## Integration Points

### With Secret Management
The server expects credentials to be provided per-call, allowing integration with:
- HashiCorp Vault
- CyberArk
- Azure Key Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager

### With Monitoring Systems
Log output can be integrated with:
- Splunk
- ELK Stack
- Azure Monitor
- Datadog

## Limitations

1. **No GUI Operations**: Cannot interact with desktop applications
2. **WinRM Required**: Target servers must have WinRM enabled
3. **Network Dependencies**: Requires direct network access to targets
4. **PowerShell Version**: Some commands may require PowerShell 5.0+

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Certificate-based authentication
- Kerberos authentication support
- Batch operations on multiple servers
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Integration with Windows Admin Center API
- Support for PowerShell DSC
- Event log streaming
- Performance baseline comparisons

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to establish WinRM connection"**
   - Enable WinRM: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`
   - Check firewall: Port 5985 (HTTP) or 5986 (HTTPS)
   - Verify credentials have remote access rights

2. **"Access Denied" errors**
   - User needs to be in Remote Management Users group
   - Check UAC settings for remote administration
   - Verify NTLM authentication is enabled

3. **Command timeout**
   - Long-running commands may exceed timeout
   - Consider breaking into smaller operations
   - Use background jobs for lengthy tasks

## Development Notes

### Adding New Diagnostic Commands
When adding new PowerShell commands:
1. Test locally first
2. Handle both success and error cases
3. Parse output for relevant information
4. Add appropriate logging
5. Update tool documentation

### Testing
Test scenarios should include:
- Connection failures
- Authentication failures
- Command execution errors
- Partial data scenarios
- Log rotation
- Concurrent operations
